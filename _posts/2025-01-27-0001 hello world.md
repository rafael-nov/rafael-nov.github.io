Hi,  

I’m available for freelance, B2B, or contract work.  
I’m open to worldwide remote opportunities or on-site roles in Portugal, Spain, or other locations.  

I am passionate about software engineering, with expertise in application development, support, DevOps, and Site Reliability Engineering. 

I’m always looking for my next opportunity to make an impact and grow.
