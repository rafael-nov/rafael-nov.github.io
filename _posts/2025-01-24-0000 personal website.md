## **Introduction**

With all the talk about AI replacing humans, I want to try out current state-of-the-art AI tools like Cursor IDE and ChatGPT, evaluate them, draw my own conclusions ...

**Web development was never my thing, but I always wanted a website, so I decided to build one.** 

Over the next 3â€“4 days, my plan is to use AI to build a personal website with:
- A useful links and bookmarks section.
- A portfolio.
- A blog.
- And possibly more...

## **Checklist**

- [X] **Have an MVP**:  
  - Set up Jekyll with a basic theme.

  - Add placeholders for future projects.

## **Reflection**

- AI tools can be a mixed bag when working on projects like this: 
- They're awesome at generating code and, with the right context and queries, can really boost productivity.
- But, they can also be a bit buggy and sometimes make things more complicated than they need to be.
- Having an experienced engineer around to guide and complement the use of AI tools is super helpful.
